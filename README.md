# SDGP - CS-79

Dedicated to addressing the pressing global issue of food scarcity while championing sustainable practices.Our mission is twofold: to mitigate the world food crisis and reduce food waste within society. 
Through our innovative approach, we bridge the gap between sellers and buyers, facilitating the repurposing of surplus food into compost. Sellers have the opportunity to offer their excess food at discounted rates or donate it to those in need, fostering a culture of generosity and resourcefulness. Buyers, in turn, utilize this surplus to produce high-quality compost, contributing to both environmental conservation and economic viability. Together, we strive to create a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
